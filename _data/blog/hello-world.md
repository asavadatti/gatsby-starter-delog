In which we examine how to find parking in SF

#### Embarcadero

On most days your best bet would be to take public transport to Embarcadero. Both the Bart and the Muni stop conveniently close to the Ferry Building. If this is not an option there are parking lots at Pier 3 and at the intersection of Washington and Embarcadero. If you get lucky you might find street parking along the Embarcadero itself. The best place to look for this is near Rincon Park (South bound). This is my preferred option as the brief walk along the water to the Ferry Building is quite enjoyable. There are limited free options in this area.

#### Fisherman's Wharf

There are couple of garages opposite the wharf but they are quite stressful to get into and find a parking spot. The smart play here is to park either in the Embarcadero lots or park closer to Ghidardelli square and walk the 3-4 blocks to Pier 39. You might have to circle around a couple of times but it is much faster than the garages. Your highest chances for finding parking are along the north end of Van Ness and near 999 Beach St. It won't be stressful as long as you stay away from the main touristy areas.

#### Fort Mason/Marina Greens

There is a small parking lot at Fort Mason where I've always found parking right away. There is a free lot between Bay St and Green Meadow Park but it is an uphill walk from Fort Mason. If you have an EV there is a free charging station there too (4kW). There is always space here or along Bay St.

#### Crissy Field

The Crissy field parking lot has ample space to park.
